                <h4 class="">I will be talking, reporting, and hopefully teaching about many of the ways we are all being thrown down and hurt in life. We are in spectacularly dangerous times and a way to survive, prosper, live ethically, and find ways to pick ourselves back up is now a very difficult course to find.

                        It is the earliest known set code of justice.<br />
                        In other places, justice was not a fixed code, but rather a system of justice set down at the moment by whoever decided each case.

                        For example, it is not unreasonable to consider the Roman Kingdom, the Roman Republic and the Roman Empire to essentially be composed of the same people, but trying many different systems during that long historical period.<br />
                    This section will try to enumerate some of these systems and their successes and failures.</h4>
